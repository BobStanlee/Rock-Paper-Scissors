# JavaScript Program: [Your Program Name]

Welcome to [Your Program Name] JavaScript project!

## Description
This JavaScript program, built entirely from scratch, serves the purpose of enabling users to engage in a game of rock-paper-scissors.

## Plan

### Game Logic
1. Create an array to facilitate user choice selection.
2. Declare an array named `playerChoice` containing options: rock, paper, and scissors.
3. Implement the functionality for the user to make a choice, followed by the program generating a choice for the computer.

### Gameplay Flow
1. Compare the user and computer choices to determine the round's result.
2. Store the results for each round.
3. Repeat the game logic until it reaches the fifth round.

This project aims to encapsulate the logic and functionality of a rock-paper-scissors game in JavaScript while offering a clear and interactive gaming experience.
